<h1>1</h1>
<h2>Good design is innovative.</h2>
<p>I believe that a design can always pushed to be better for human use. We must always strive to create things to be the better version of its old self. I always want to create new and exciting work so I always ask myself "has anyone else done this?".</p>
		
	
<h1>2</h1>
<h2>Good Design makes a product useful.</h2>
<p>A bad design is useless and vice-versa. Design needs to be able to help fix problems instead of create them and especially in my industrial design classes, I made sure to pick a product that will be of use to others.</p>		

<h1>3</h1>
<h2>Good design is aesthetic.</h2>
<p>Although some people might deabate this or feel like aesthetic is secondary, I truly believe that good design needs to be eye-pleasing. This can sometimes be the deciding factor whether a consumer buys your product or not and so I try to make my work as aesthetically pleasing as possible for the viewers and users.</p>
	
<h1>4.</h1>
<h2>Good design makes a product understandable.</h2>
<p>I feel like this ties in with the second point but yes, good design needs to be easy to use and although it depends case-to-case, I believe it needs to be understandable enough that kids can figure out to use it however I have a theory that "simple" does not always equal to "understandable". I try to make my work understable </p>	

<h1>5</h1>
<h2>Good design is unobtrusive.</h2>
<p>I don't necessarily see the point of this rule. I feel like it defys what I want to embody when I create. Maybe to some extent? Maybe the design shouldn't necessarily overshadow the product itself but I also think that if your design isn't making a statement, why make it? For example, I want the colors of my calculator to make sense why I picked them and I want them to be a key factor in my design.</p>
	
<h1>6</h1>
<h2>Good design is honest.</h2>
<p>I like this rule as not a lot of people understand the imprortance of honesty in designs. People nowadays can tell whether or not a brand is being genuine with their intentions or are saying things they wanna hear. A way I incorporate this with my work </p>	
	
<h1>7</h1>
<h2>Good design is long-lasting.</h2>
<p>The problem with long-lasting work is that only time will tell. We can't look at something and decide whether or not it's timeless or not; it needs to stand against the test of time and has to still be relevant, 10, 20, 50 years from now, like the Nike symbol or Coca-Cola's famous type. I haven't really been able to incorporate my work with this rule yet (as I've only been a design student for 3 years) but I can say that I try as much as possible to analyze my work and make sure it's more classical as classical things are "classical" for a reason.</p>	

<h1>8</h1>
<h2>Good design is thorough down to the last detail.</h2>
<p>I feel like if you are a designer that doesn't think about EVERY SINGLE DETAIL, you're not a good designer. Fortunately (but unfortunately) for me, I overthink a lot and designers are great overthinkers! So being meticulous, revising work, and having attention to detail is a great thing to practice as a designer to create good designs.</p>	
	
<h1>9</h1>
<h2>Good design is environmentally-friendly.</h2>
<p>This is unfortunately not public knowledge but having sustainable, environment friendly designs are awesome! We have very little time on earth and we need to take care of the planet while we're here. I do this by being eco-conscious in EVERYTHING that I do, not just my work so instead of buying new wood for my project, I use extra wood from the UIC shop.</p>
	
<h1>10</h1>
<h2>Good design is as little design as possible.</h2>
<p>Another point that might be up for debate for a lot of people but I think it depends; if the product you make SHOULD be simple, then yes, it should have as little design as possible. If not, it doesn't mean it's BAD, just excessive. In my work, I haven't done much of this but being in UIC's design program, I am trained to make things simpler and strip extra things away as much as possible.</p>
