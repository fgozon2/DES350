</div>

	
<div class="gooddesign">
<h3>Good design</h3>
</div>		

<div id="grad1"></div>	
	
	
<div class="toptext">
<p>I believe that a design can always pushed to be better for human use. We must always strive to create things to be the better version of its old self. I always want to create new and exciting work so I always ask myself "has anyone else done this?".</p>	
<h4>is innovative.</h4>	
	
<p>Although some people might deabate this or feel like aesthetic is secondary, I truly believe that good design needs to be eye-pleasing. This can sometimes be the deciding factor whether a consumer buys your product or not and so I try to make my work as aesthetically pleasing as possible for the viewers and users.</p>
<h4>is aesthetic.</h4>	

<p>I feel like this ties in with
the second point but yes, 
good design needs to be
easy to use and fairly
understandable enough 
that kids can figure it out.
A lot of my work tends to
be on the more minimaistic
side. Very simple and clean.
I, however also believe that 
"simple" does not always equal 
to "understandable". 
</p>
<h4>makes a product understandable.</h4>	

<p>I don't necessarily see the point of this rule. I feel like it defys what I want to embody when I create. Maybe to some extent? Maybe the design shouldn't necessarily overshadow the product itself but I also think that if your design isn't making a statement, why make it? For example, I want the colors of my calculator to make sense why I picked them and I want them to be a key factor in my design. </p>		
<h4>is unobtrusive.</h4>	
		
<p>I like this rule as not a lot of people understand the imprortance of honesty in designs. People nowadays can tell whether or not a brand is being genuine with their intentions or are saying things they wanna hear. A way I incorporate this in my work is, quitehonestly, being frank,sarcastic and realistic humor with the process. Design isnâ€™t easy and no one has ever said it was; so why make it seem like I whipped everything up in 10 minutes when I really slaved over it for 10 days?</p>		
<h4>is honest.</h4>
	
<p>The problem with long-lasting work is that only 
time will tell. We can't look at something and 
decide whether or not it's timeless or not; it 
needs to stand against the test of time and has
to still be relevant, 10, 20, 50 years from now, 
like the Nike symbol or Coca-Cola's famous type.
I haven't really been able to incorporate my work
with this rule yet (as I've only been a design student
for 3 years) but I can say that I try as much as 
possible to analyze my work and make sure it's more
classical as classical things are "classical" for a reason.</p>		
<h4>is long-lasting.</h4>
